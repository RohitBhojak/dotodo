## About The Project

DoTODO is a comprehensive to-do list application designed to showcase a clean and robust software architecture. The primary goal of this project was to implement a highly modular and loosely coupled system using Object-Oriented Programming and SOLID design principles.

The application's logic is cleanly separated from the DOM, ensuring that the core functionality is independent of the user interface. This separation makes the codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale. The UI is inspired by a classic hacker terminal aesthetic and is fully responsive, providing a unique and functional user experience across all devices.
